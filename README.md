## A scientific workflow infrastructure for Plant Phenomics on the Grid

Plant phenotyping consists in the observation of physical and biochemical traits of plant genotypes in response to environmental conditions.
Challenges, in particular in context of climate change and food security, are numerous. High-throughput platforms have been introduced
to observe the  dynamic growth of a large number of plants in different environmental
conditions. Instead of considering a few genotypes at a time (as it is the case when phenomic traits are measured manually), such platforms make it possible to use completely new kinds of approaches.
However, the data sets produced by such widely instrumented platforms are huge, constantly augmenting and produced by increasingly complex experiments, reaching a point where distributed computation is mandatory to extract knowledge from data.

In this paper, we introduce [InfraPhenoGrid], the infrastructure we designed and deploy to efficiently manage data sets produced by the
[PhenoArch] plant phenomics platform in the context of the French [Phenome] Project. Our solution consists in deploying [OpenAlea] scientific workflows on a Grid using the [SciFloware] middleware to pilot workflow executions. Our approach is user-friendly
in the sense that despite the intrinsic complexity of the infrastructure,
running scientific workflows and understanding results obtained (using provenance information) is kept as simple as possible for end-users.
